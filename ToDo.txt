!!! 1) Refactor methods in MethodsNeeded.txt !!!
    -> see end of this file, there's a dependency to resolve
       (reference to a method from another class)


Methods needed to process missing xml paths in one file:

  - FileContentSeeker.GenerateListOfMissingsInFile
    (generate the list of missing xml paths in the file) -> final result we want
    -> use encapsulation of collection (return unmodifiable collection)

    -> cf file MethodsNeeded.txt for dependencies
